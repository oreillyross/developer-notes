== CSS

When using Precss in the postcss always adhere to the convention of naming your
css files with an _underscore, i.e. _base.css. This ensures your css files are treated as
modules by the postcss compiler.

=== Fonts

1rem is usually equal to about 16px

To get a good sizing ratio set a css element
`
html {
  font-size: 62.5% # comment - this ensures your 1 rem = 10px and setting a 1.8rem means its 18px

}
`

=== BEM Standard (Block Element Modifier)

BEM follows a simple method which can be described in just one selector
block__element--modifier example. We can relate blocks to React components,
elements to component children, and modifiers to props which may modify
block or element look and feel.

An example is card__title--active selector name which conveys style for Card
component or block, title child node or element, when active prop or modifier
is set to true.
