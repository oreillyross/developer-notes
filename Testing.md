# React and Javascript testing

### Install
- npm install @testing-library/react
- npm install jest
- Jest by Orta vs code extension

Whatever test runner and assertion library you use, a failing unit test should tell you at a glance:

. What is the expected behavior?
. What was the actual result?
. What is the expected result?
. How is the behavior reproduced?
