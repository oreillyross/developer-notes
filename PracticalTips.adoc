=== Developer productivity tips

* First thing in the morning, do not look at your phone. Simply do something, anything else
  but check twitter, emails, whatsapp, slack etc.
* Clear your inbox (if you are using gmail of course). Having a empty inbox lessens the mental

  does not show on initial page load, you see a nice picture of the sun.
